# HelpNature

We built this webapp in order to keep people alert about the disasters and extinction of animals due to doings of the people.
So, we put blogs in order to notify people about these situations by also allowing them to blog their experiences from posts people can 
post a frivolous act including people dumping garbage on to the roads and share their ideas on them Also we also made it easier to sell 
ecofriendly products.
